* Midas

This is a collection of scripts used to correlate rankings of the one
million most visited sites per day (Alexa Top1M files) and information
from CrunchBase [fn:1]. The final goal is to make a prediction whether
an enterprise will receive a funding of the type ~angel~, ~seed~ or
~a~ soon.

The several scripts are written to run under Hadoop.

Further documentation is provided in the ~doc~ folder via Sphinx.

The code is tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.

If you intend to work with the tools I provide here, please contact me
so that I can provide further information. As for now, I am too lazy
to document properly how to use this stuff. :)

* Footnotes

[fn:1] To fetch the data from CrunchBase another, separate package
  should be used. It can be found on
  [[https://github.com/fuzzy-id/crawlcrunch]].
