This is a collection of scripts used to correlate rankings of the one
million most visited sites per day and information from
CrunchBase [fn:1]. The final goal is to make a prediction whether an
enterprise will receive a funding of the type ~angel~, ~seed~ or ~a~
soon.

The several scripts are written to run under Hadoop.

* Transforming the Data

The data comes in a rather unhandy format for our purpose:

A mapper and a reducer to be run in a MapReduce framework (known to
work in Hadoop). It converts a zipped csv-file named
~top-1m-2012-09-03.csv.zip~ of the form

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1,foo
2,bar
#+END_EXAMPLE

into two csv-files. One being ~foo.csv.zip~

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2012-09-03, 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

and another one being ~bar.csv.zip~

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2012-09-03, 2
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Footnotes

[fn:1] To fetch the data from CrunchBase another, separate script was
  used. It can be found on [[https://github.com/fuzzy-id/crawlcrunch]].
