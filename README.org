This is a collection of scripts used to correlate rankings of the one
million most visited sites per day (Alexa Top1M files) and information
from CrunchBase. The final goal is to make a prediction whether
an enterprise will receive a funding of the type ~angel~, ~seed~ or
~a~ with a lead time of 90 days.

The code in this repository covers two steps:
1) Fetching the data from CrunchBase, pre-processing the whole data
   set (including the Alexa sites) and generate samples.
2) Use the samples to generate a set of features and run C5.0 in order
   to build classifiers from these.

The first step is summarized entirely in the shell script
~commands_sample_generation.sh~.

For the second step a program is needed which is not publicly
available.
