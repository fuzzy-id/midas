This is rather a collection of helpful tools I used to fetch data from
tho CrunchBase.com API. It is not complete as I only needed the
companies and from these only the funding rounds.

Anyways, the code is written so that it should be very easy to get
more data fields of the companies and no so difficult to fetch other
data then companies.

The code is tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.

If you intend to work with the tools I provide here, please contact me
so that I can provide further information. As for now, I am too lazy
to document properly how to use this stuff. :)
